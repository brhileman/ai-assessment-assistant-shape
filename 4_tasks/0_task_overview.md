## Core Technical Requirements

### Authentication
- **Admin Only**: Devise passwordless with magic links
- **Admin Allowlist**: Manual admin creation via seeds/console
- **Stakeholder Access**: UUID token-based links (no authentication required)

### Email System
- **SendGrid Integration**: All email delivery (magic links, invitations, thank you emails)
- **Email Types**: Admin authentication, stakeholder invitations, assessment completion

### Voice Integration
- **OpenAI Realtime API**: Live voice conversation with AI agent
- **Real-time Transcripts**: Live display during conversation
- **Company Context**: Custom instructions passed to AI agent

### Data Model
```
Company (name, custom_instructions)
  └── has_many Stakeholders (name, email, invitation_token UUID)
      └── has_one Assessment (full_transcript, completed_at)
```

### Design System
- **Admin Pages**: Light theme with traditional business styling
- **Voice Interface**: Modern dark theme with glassmorphism and gradients
- **Mobile-First**: Voice interface optimized for all devices

## User Story Mapping

| User Story | Primary Task | Supporting Tasks |

| 6. Voice Assessment Experience | Task 7 | Task 8 |
| 7. Real-Time Transcript Viewing | Task 8 | Task 7 |
| 8. Assessment Completion | Task 8 | Task 9 |
| 9. Assessment Results Review | Task 9 | Task 3, 8 |
| 10. System Performance | Task 10 | All tasks |
| 11. Data Security | Task 10 | All tasks |

## Development Strategy

### MVP Focus
- **Single Assessment Per Stakeholder**: Simplified relationship model
- **Basic Email Templates**: SendGrid or Rails views (whichever easier)
- **Essential Security Only**: No over-engineering for MVP
- **Manual Admin Management**: Seeds/console creation vs. registration flow

### Quality Standards
- **Rails Conventions**: Follow standard practices with RSpec tests
- **Small Methods**: Under 10 lines, use POROs if needed
- **Component Design**: Follow established design system
- **E2E Testing**: Capybara for critical user flows

### Task Completion Workflow
1. **Create Feature Branch**: Before starting each task
2. **Follow Task Checklist**: Complete all subtasks
3. **Review & Refactor**: Improve code quality before commit  
4. **Check Off Progress**: Update task file tracking
5. **Open Pull Request**: Include task content in PR description
6. **Merge & Deploy**: Continuous integration approach

## Success Criteria

Each task must meet these criteria before considered complete:
- [ ] All subtasks checked off in task file
- [ ] Code follows Rails conventions and design system
- [ ] Tests written and passing (unit + integration)
- [ ] Feature branch merged via pull request
- [ ] Documentation updated where applicable

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Task 1**: Generate Rails application foundation
2. **Get User Approval**: Review each major milestone before proceeding
3. **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Expect refinements, especially for voice interface
4. **Deploy Early**: Get working version on Heroku as soon as core features complete

This task structure ensures we build a production-ready AI Assessment Assistant that meets all user needs while maintaining code quality and following established design patterns.
