## Implementation Details

### Admin Model Configuration
```ruby
class Admin < ApplicationRecord
  devise :magic_link_authenticatable, :trackable
  
  validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true
  validates :email, inclusion: { 
    in: Rails.application.credentials.admin_allowlist || [],
    message: "is not authorized for admin access"
  }
  
  def send_magic_link
    # Custom magic link delivery logic
  end
end
```

### Allowlist Management
```ruby
# db/seeds.rb
admin_emails = [
  'admin@launchpadlab.com',
  'assessment@launchpadlab.com'
]

admin_emails.each do |email|
  Admin.find_or_create_by(email: email)
end
```

### Routes Configuration
```ruby
# config/routes.rb
devise_for :admins, controllers: {
  magic_links: 'admins/magic_links'
}

namespace :admin do
  root 'dashboard#index'
  # Additional admin routes will be added in later tasks
end
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Admin can request magic link via email
- [ ] Magic link email is delivered and branded correctly
- [ ] Magic link allows successful authentication
- [ ] Only allowlisted emails can receive magic links
- [ ] Admin routes are protected from unauthenticated access
- [ ] Admin can log out successfully
- [ ] All tests pass including system tests
- [ ] Email delivery works in both development and production

## Security Considerations

- **Magic Link Expiration**: Links expire after 1 hour
- **Single Use**: Magic links can only be used once
- **Email Validation**: Only allowlisted email addresses accepted
- **CSRF Protection**: All forms include CSRF tokens
- **Secure Headers**: Add security headers for admin pages

## Next Steps

After Task 2 completion:
- Task 3: Create database models for Companies, Stakeholders, and Assessments
- Task 4: Build admin dashboard with company management interface
- The authentication foundation enables all subsequent admin functionality
