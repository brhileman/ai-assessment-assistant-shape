### Dark Theme:
- **Development Time**: Faster to implement
- **Maintenance**: Lower (fewer components)
- **Performance**: Better (minimal animations, smaller payload)

## User Experience Considerations

### Light Theme:
- More engaging visual feedback

## Conclusion

The **dark theme simplified version** aligns better with the core use case of voice conversations where visual distractions should be minimized. It follows modern design principles of progressive disclosure and focuses user attention on the essential task: having a conversation with the AI.

The **light theme version** provides a more traditional business application experience with comprehensive status information and visual feedback.

**Recommendation**: Start with the dark simplified theme for MVP development, then consider adding optional visual enhancements in future iterations based on user feedback.
