# User Story: Data Security

**As a** system administrator  
**I want** all conversation data to be securely stored and transmitted  
**So that** client confidential information is protected

## Context
The AI Assessment Assistant handles sensitive business information requiring enterprise-level security measures to protect client data and maintain trust.

## Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. All data transmission occurs over encrypted connections
2. Conversation transcripts are stored with encryption in the database
3. Assessment links are unique and secure (no expiration for MVP)
4. Admin access is properly authenticated and authorized
5. All data access is logged for audit purposes

### Edge Cases
- Security breach attempt: System blocks unauthorized access and logs incidents
- Data export requests: Secure handling with proper authorization
- Compliance audit: Complete audit trail available

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] HTTPS encryption for all data transmission
- [ ] Encrypted database storage for sensitive data
- [ ] Secure unique links (UUID tokens)
- [ ] Admin role-based access controls
- [ ] Audit logging for data access
- [ ] GDPR compliance for data handling

## Security Measures
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Database encryption at rest
- Secure session management
- Regular security assessments
- Data retention policies

## MVP Decisions
- **Additional compliance certifications (SOC 2, HIPAA)**: Not needed for MVP
- **Data anonymization features**: Not implemented for MVP - simple data handling
- **Geographic data residency options**: Not needed for MVP
- **Link expiration**: No expiration for assessment links (MVP simplicity)
- **Audit logging**: Basic logging for security, not comprehensive audit trails
