# User Story: Assessment Results Review

**As a** LaunchPad Lab administrator  
**I want** to review completed assessment transcripts  
**So that** I can analyze client AI readiness and provide tailored recommendations

## Context
Administrators need easy access to conversation transcripts to understand client needs and prepare assessment reports.

## Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. Admin views company dashboard showing completed assessments
2. Admin clicks on a specific stakeholder's completed assessment
3. Admin views the complete conversation transcript
4. Admin can export transcript for further analysis

### Edge Cases
- Very long transcripts: Implement scrolling for basic viewing
- Incomplete assessments: Show partial transcripts with status indicator
- Missing assessment: Show message if stakeholder hasn't completed assessment yet

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] List view of all completed assessments per company
- [ ] Full transcript display with timestamps
- [ ] Export transcript to PDF/text format
- [ ] Assessment metadata (duration, completion date, stakeholder info)

## Key Screens
- Company assessment results dashboard
- Individual transcript viewer
- Export tools

## MVP Decisions
- **Search functionality**: Not implemented for MVP - basic scrolling sufficient
- **Admin notes/comments**: Not needed for MVP
- **Advanced analytics**: Not needed for MVP - simple export for external analysis
- **AI-powered summarization**: Not needed for MVP
