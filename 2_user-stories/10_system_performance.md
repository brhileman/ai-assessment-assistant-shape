# User Story: System Performance

**As a** system user (admin or stakeholder)  
**I want** the application to respond quickly and reliably  
**So that** I can complete my tasks efficiently without frustration

## Context
Both administrators and stakeholders need responsive performance to maintain engagement and productivity during voice assessments and administrative tasks.

## Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. User navigates to any page in under 3 seconds
2. Voice conversation has minimal latency during real-time interaction
3. Real-time transcript updates smoothly without lag
4. SendGrid delivers email invitations and magic links promptly
5. System maintains high availability during business hours

### Edge Cases
- High traffic periods: System maintains performance under load
- Poor internet connection: Graceful degradation with helpful error messages
- Server issues: Clear error messages with suggested actions
- SendGrid rate limits: Graceful handling of email sending limits

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Page load times under 3 seconds
- [ ] Voice conversation with minimal latency (<500ms)
- [ ] Real-time transcript updates without lag
- [ ] Reliable SendGrid email delivery within 2 minutes
- [ ] 99.5% uptime during business hours
- [ ] Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

## Key Metrics
- Response time monitoring
- Voice conversation latency tracking
- SendGrid email delivery success rates and bounce rates
- System uptime monitoring

## MVP Decisions
- **Performance monitoring dashboards**: Not needed for MVP - keep it simple
- **Automated alerting**: Use lightweight, off-the-shelf tools for basic performance alerts
- **Monitoring approach**: Basic metrics tracking without complex dashboard setup
- **Error handling**: Focus on user-friendly error messages over detailed logging
